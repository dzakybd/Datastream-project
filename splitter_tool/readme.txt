This software is an implementation of the Splitter method, which mines sequential movement patterns from semantic trajectories.  Splitter is introduced in the following paper:

"Splitter: Mining Fine-Grained Sequential Patterns in Semantic Trajectories". Chao Zhang, Jiawei Han, Lidan Shou, Jiajun Lu, Thomas La Porta.  Proceedings of the 40th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases (VLDB), 2014.

==================== Input ====================

* sequences.txt
  - This file contains the semantic trajectories of different users;
  - Each line corresponds to the trajectory of one user;
  - Each line has the format: <timestamp> place_id -1 <timestamp> place_id -1 <timestamp> place_id -1 -2
    (-1 means there are more items in the trajectory, -2 marks the end of the trajectory.)

* places.csv
  - This file contains the information about the places;
  - Each line corresponds to one place;
  - Each line has the format: place_id, lat, lng, list_of_category
  (There is a list of category because Foursquare POIs are organized into a hierarchy)

* category.csv
  - This file contains the mapping from category_id to category_description;
  - It is just for interpretation purposes.


==================== Output ====================

* patterns.txt
  - This file contains the patterns generated by Splitter;
  - Each line includes a sequence of a group as well as the support of the pattern. 

* groups.txt
  - This file contains the information of the group;
  - Each line corresponds to one group, which is a collection of places.

* stats.txt
  - This file contains the statistics after running Splitter;
  - It includes: the time for mining coarse patterns, the time for mining fine patterns; the number of patterns; and the coverage.


==================== Parameters ====================

All the parameters can be specified in a YAML file. We also provide default settings in the source code.

The parameters are described as follows:

* inputDir: the directory for the input
* outputDir: the directory for the output
* minSup: the minimum support
* varThreshold: the spatial variance threshold that determines whether a pattern is compact enough
* maxInterval: the maximum time gap (in minute)
* tau: the decaying parameter
* bandwidth: the meanshift bandwidth



==================== Usage ====================

Example command for running this tool with config file:
java -jar -Xmx2G splitter.jar 4sq.yaml

Example command for running this tool without config file:
java -jar -Xmx2G splitter.jar
